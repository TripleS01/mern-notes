Simple Note App
Description

A simple note-taking application with a front-end and back-end setup. The app allows users to create, get, edit, and delete notes, with data stored in MongoDB.

The server expects a local connection to MongoDB.

Ensure you have the following software installed:
Node.js
MongoDB
